## NixVim config

This is my personal nixvim config. To run make sure nix is installed and run `nix run .`.

## Modifying the configuration

Looking at https://nix-community.github.io/nixvim/search/ to look for options and plugins is very helpful.

## Adding support for a language

Add the language to `treesitter.nix` and to `lsp.nix`.
